# Ada-Checkers-GUI-Application

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
The canvas(or board) may not display properly at times. Please either minimize, maximize, or otherwise force the board to be redrawn by your computer. We believe this is a symptom of either the Canvas or JEWL library, however it is beyond the scope of the project.

This project creates and runs a two-player Checkers game in the programming language Ada, specifically Ada 2012. The program uses an extension called JEWL to create a simple GUI. Credits are linked below. 
 
* GUI was made using the John English Windows Library (JEWL) which can be found here: http://archive.adaic.com/tools/bindings/JEWL/jewl.html 
* This project was a group effort. See the credits below. Credits are also listed within the program itself (located within the main.adb file).

Ada is an interesting language and we designed this project to show its flexibility. There are other GUI packages out there such as GTKada.
